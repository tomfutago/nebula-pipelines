Even when designing a ship more akin to a moving city, the Terrans did not forget to give the vessel the visual polish it deserved. The Chrysalis served the Terran Colonial Union well when arriving through the Gateway; as the TCUâ€™s colonization phase slowed, they began to appear in public and private auctions.",
